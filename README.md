Map & Storytelling Platform

## Setup

This server is expecting a `MONGO_URI` environment variable defined in a `.env` file at root level.
You can check out the schema for `User` and `Order` collections inside the directory `models`.
That will help you populate the db with initial data if needed.

## Install and run:

Unsurprisingly, run

```sh
npm i
npm start
```

inside the root directory in order to run.

## Example requests
